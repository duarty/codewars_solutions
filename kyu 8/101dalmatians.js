101 Dalmatians - squash the bugs, not the dogs!

Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be alive!)... He arrives back with multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to respond!

By repairing the function provided, you will find out exactly how you should respond, depending on the number of dogs he has.

The number of dogs will always be a number and there will always be at least 1 dog.

function howManyDalmatians(n){
    let dogs = ["Hardly any", "More than a handful!", "Woah that's a lot of dogs!", "101 DALMATIANS!!!"]; //dogs stores a array of string
       if (n <= 10){ //check if n is less or equal 10 
         return dogs[0] // if n <= 10 is true return dogs in index 0
       }else if (n > 10 && n <= 50){ //checks if n is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 50
         return dogs[1] //if n is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 5 is true return dogs in index 1
       }else if( n > 50 && n <= 100){ //checks if n is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 100

       }else if(n == 101){ // if n == 101
