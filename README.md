 just some of my simple coderwars solutions in javaScript to keep up with my evolution as a dev..
 
I know there are hundreds of ways to solve a problem, some with superior performance, but as I said, I'm doing this to follow my evolution during my journey as a dev. In the near future I hope to remake these katas in another language.
